# How to log in and use the iLabs

The iLab machines are computers all CS students can use for their homework and projects: [https://report.cs.rutgers.edu/nagiosnotes/iLab-machines.html](https://report.cs.rutgers.edu/nagiosnotes/iLab-machines.html)&#x20;



### Creating an Account

If you are eligible[^1] and have no account, please [Activate your CS Account](https://services.cs.rutgers.edu/accounts/) and [Create your CS Password.](https://services.cs.rutgers.edu/accounts/changepass/changepass)

### Logging into the iLabs

All iLab machines are accessible remotely via a web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox or Safari using [WebLogin](https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/docs/using-cs-weblogin-to-access-ilab-machines/), SSH client like ssh command on MacOS and Linux or [Bitvise Client on Windows](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download). (See [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJjEhWC0XYQ) or [SSH HowTo](https://www.howtogeek.com/311287/how-to-connect-to-an-ssh-server-from-windows-macos-or-linux/)), [X2GO](https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/docs/other/x2go/) and [Windows Remote Desktop](https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/docs/computer-systems/windows-remote-desktop/).

Notes:

* All [iLab](https://ilab.cs.rutgers.edu/) machines are configured the same way.
* Machines in [Hill Center 248/252/254](https://maps.rutgers.edu/#/?lat=40.52185495910643\&lng=-74.46239418071269\&selected=3752\&sidebar=true\&zoom=17) public labs are accessible by visiting these labs and remotely.
* Unless noted, if you can login to one, you can login on all iLab machines below.
* For security reason, we do not allow [public/private key login](https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/ssh-keys-public-keys-authentication-issues/). Instead we support [Kerberos Authentication for passwordless login](https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/docs/setting-up-kerberos-support-for-your-home-or-office-machine/). For better security, we recommend users to enable Two factor authentication via [IPA/Kerberos Server](https://services.cs.rutgers.edu/two-factor.html) or [Google Authenticator.](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/\~makmur/howto/googleauthenticator/index.html)
* Public printer named [Hill2](https://report.cs.rutgers.edu/nagios/cgi-bin/status.cgi?host=hill2.cs.rutgers.edu\&style=detail) is located at Hill Center 252 corridor. You must [release your print job](https://oit-nb.rutgers.edu/service/printing/how-do-i-release-my-print-job) with your RUID Card within 30 minutes or it gets deleted.
* For bigger, better, faster and _more reliable_ machines, use machines listed as iLabServers.
* Before running a long and big job, please consult [Limitation Enforced On CS Linux Machines.](https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/docs/limitation-enforced-on-cs-linux-machines/)
* Users have access to TerraBytes of disk space but Home directory has at least 50GB of quota. For details see [other storage options](https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/docs/file-storage/storage-technology-options/).
